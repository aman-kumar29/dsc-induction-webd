## Front-End (E-commerce Website):
### Tech Stacks used: Html, CSS and Bootstraps


a.homepage.html - This is the first page of the website. It contains a header with a navigation bar containing links Home, Shops (dropdown Menu), Brands, and Login/Signup bar. Then there are three sections below containing Fashion, Footwear, and Watches. Here to make things beautiful I used the layout option n which the whole row was divided into columns using container class After that there were different brands which were most loved. At the end there was footer tag which contained different sections like Men, Women, Watches and other useful links.
